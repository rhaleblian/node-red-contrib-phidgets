# node-red-phidget

Node wrappers for Phidgets devices.

This project is just getting started; nothing is yet releaseable.
Things that have tested positive:

* very basic RFID reading
* initialization of a 40x4 LCD with text

Some nodes are still just stubs.

node-red-phidget adopts [StandardJS](https://github.com/standard/standard#install) for style.
